description: We've just received a report of The WSSQR NEWs publishing an article that is causing a lot of concern and fear in the public. Given its wording and theme,
I am sure it's fake news generated by some TP student. However, WSSQR will not disclose their source. Here's a part of the article, you will need to find the exact number of people that went through Southern Cross Station at the exact time referenced so we can determine if the article is fake.
The railway station has released a statement saying that all footage of that night has been deleted so I can't provide you with it.

Article Text~ "Wild scenes as 40 people confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 ran through a railway station at 5:00am on Monday, the 16th of June 2020. 
The frightening witness account has caused panic buying at stores around the country as people prepare to stay indoors. 
Our source confirms they were the only witness and that this infectious routine could be happening at other major transport venues through the country without the public's knowledge."

Find the exact number of pedestrians that walked on that station during the exact day and time and format it in wwssqrctf{x} (where x is the digit only)
